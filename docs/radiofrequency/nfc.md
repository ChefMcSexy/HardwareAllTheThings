# Near Field Communication (NFC)

### Replay Attacks
Replay attack is a technique where a malicious user could implement a device to intercept a NFC transaction and redeem it later, using other device or even in different location. 

### Relay Attack
The relay attack is a technique where a malicious user implements a man in the middle attack. The attacker(APDUer) is capable to intercept, manipulate and change the transaction in real time to take advantage of it.
